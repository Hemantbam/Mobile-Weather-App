# Weather App

This is a simple Weather App built with React Native. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays the current weather conditions of a given city. It also maintains a search history of the last 3 searched cities using `AsyncStorage`, allowing users to quickly access past searches.

## Features
- Search for weather by city name.
- Display current weather information including temperature, weather description, and a weather based picture.
- Store the last 3 searched cities in the local storage (via `AsyncStorage`) and display them as clickable items for quick access.
- Displays weather data in a user-friendly interface with a responsive design.
